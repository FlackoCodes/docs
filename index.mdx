title: Cleva Auth Endpoint
description: "This endpoint registers a new user in the Cleva platform.
It collects personal or business details, validates the provided information (such as a Ghana Card number), and creates a user account.
Upon successful registration, the API responds with an access token that can be used to authenticate future requests.
Supports JSON payloads and returns standard HTTP status codes for both success and error handling.
