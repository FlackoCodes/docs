# Authentication Endpoints

This section covers endpoints related to user authentication for businesses.

---

## Authorization

All authenticated endpoints require a **Bearer Token** in the `Authorization` header.

You obtain this token by successfully registering or logging in via the relevant authentication endpoints.  
Include the token in your requests as follows:

---

### POST `{BASE_URL}/auth/register`

Registers a new user in the Cleva platform.  
It accepts personal information, validates identity (via Ghana Card number), and returns an access token on success.  
This token must be used as a Bearer Token in the Authorization header for all subsequent authenticated API requests.
